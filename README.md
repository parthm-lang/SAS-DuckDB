**SAS DuckDB:**

**Proc SQL (multi table wildcard):**
This code demonstrates how to perform multi-table SQL queries in SAS using both the traditional SAS engine and the newer sasioduk engine. The first section shows the pre-2025.07 workflow, where 12 monthly SAS datasets must be manually combined into a single annual dataset before running a query. The second section showcases the post-2025.07 approach, where sasioduk reads Parquet files directly and supports wildcard paths, allowing SQL queries to span multiple months or years without data-step consolidation. Together, the code highlights the differences in setup and workflow between SAS dataset processing and the more streamlined, multi-file querying capabilities of sasioduk.

**Reading ADLS**:
This code demonstrates how to use the sasioduk engine to read Parquet data directly from Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS2) using cloud-native authentication. It establishes a SASIODUK libname, opens a DuckDB connection, and runs initialization commands inside DuckDB to enable cloud file access by installing and loading the httpfs and azure extensions. The code then creates a secure authentication secret using Azure Managed Identity (no keys or passwords required). After setup, a SQL query is executed through the DuckDB connection to read Parquet files from an ADLS2 path using a wildcard pattern, illustrating how SAS can seamlessly query cloud-hosted datasets without data movement or local staging.

**Reading AWS S3:**
This code demonstrates how to use the sasioduk engine to read Parquet data directly from an AWS S3 bucket. It begins by establishing a SASIODUK libname and connecting to DuckDB, then runs setup commands inside DuckDB to enable cloud file access by installing and loading the httpfs and aws extensions. The code creates an S3 credential secret that provides the authentication details needed for DuckDB to access protected S3 objects. After the environment is configured, a SQL query is issued through the DuckDB connection to read a Parquet file stored in S3, illustrating how SAS can seamlessly query cloud-based datasets without requiring data downloads or intermediate staging

**Reading Parquet:**
This code demonstrates two different ways to assign and use the sasioduk engine when working with Parquet files, showing how SAS can read multi-file datasets using wildcard paths. In Part 1, all connection parameters—including file_type and file_path—are specified directly in the libname statement, allowing procedures like PROC CONTENTS, PROC MEANS, and PROC PRINT to reference Parquet files simply by pointing to wildcarded directory patterns. In Part 2, only the file_path is defined in the libname, while the file_type is supplied at the time each dataset reference is used. Both approaches illustrate how to explore full-year or single-month data without manual file enumeration, highlighting the flexibility of sasioduk in handling Parquet datasets.
